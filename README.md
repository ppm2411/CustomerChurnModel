# CustomerChurnModel
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer behavior and service usage patterns, the model identifies customers who are likely to leave a company.

Achieved an accuracy of **79.75%** using logistic regression after detailed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning.

## 🔍 Project Highlights
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover churn trends.
- Preprocessing steps including missing value treatment, encoding, and scaling.
- Built and evaluated multiple models with a focus on **logistic regression**.
- Final model achieves **79.75% accuracy** on test data.

## 📁 Use Case
This type of churn analysis is essential for industries such as:
- Telecom
- SaaS platforms
- E-commerce
- Banking
